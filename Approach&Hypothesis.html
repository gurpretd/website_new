<h1><u>APPROACH</u></h1>
<ul>
	<li type="disc">Advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and dynamic computer simulation models will be applied in order to evaluate the theoretical performance of different CO<sub>2</sub> refrigeration and AC system solutions at elevated ambient temperatures.</li>
	<li>The tools will facilitate to identify an optimum design of the transcritical pilot installations. Furthermore, charging of energy storage during off-peak hours will be simulated to develop an overall approach for energy usage and integration into Smart Grids of the future. </li>
	<li>After the verification by simulations, and experimental validation obtained with adapted equipment at SINTEF laboratory, a transcritical system for tropical climates will be designed, manufactured and implemented in the laboratories at IIT Madras. </li>
	<li>Comparison to a conventional system and demonstration of the pilot unit to local vendors and potential end users will be a vital part of the project. </li>
</ul>
<h1><u>HYPOTHESIS</u></h1>


<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000"><i>Leapfrog towards CO2 refrigeration technology will be possible in India, if the performance of the pilot installations reaches or exceeds the expectations of the potential end users. </i></font></p>
<ul>
	<li>The results will be disseminated towards various audiences, through participation at national and international IIR conferences, open workshops, active websites, and publication of peer reviewed journal articles (International Journal of Refrigeration). </li>
	<li>The laboratory environment will allow 100% control over the system boundary conditions and provides flexibility for modifications and optimization loops. </li>
	<li>Investigations will focus in the first place on component, control and system performances.</li>
	<li>Detailed experimental analysis of the main components of the system is also an important part of the scientific work performed in close cooperation between SINTEF and IIT Madras. </li>
	<li>Comparison of different cycle modifications will allow optimization of the system for the most efficient solution arrangement, share of thermal storage, operating condition and control strategies. </li>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000">Based on the theoretical analysis and experimental findings it will be possible to define the advantages and limitations of applying CO<sub>2</sub> as a single working fluid in Indian commercial refrigeration and AC units. After successful testing and verification of the ejector supported CO<sub>2</sub> refrigeration system at IIT Madras, the project team, including the industrial partners and potential end users, will identify suitable field installation sites in India and Norway.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000">Together with the supply industry, Danfoss as a global OEM, the first pilot installations in supermarkets will be monitored and support will be given to the local suppliers to strengthen their CO<sub>2</sub> refrigeration knowledge.</font></p>
