	<li type="disc" style="font-size:18px"><b>Compliance with strategic documents:</b>
	<dd><p align="justify">SINTEF ER is a major actor in the Norwegian researchcommunity and has over many years built an extensive knowledge on refrigeration, heating, airconditioning and ventilation systems in general as well as on systems specifically developed forsupermarkets. Through projects such as CREATIV, EFFORT, and ROMA, SINTEF ER hasgained expertise within relevant scientific areas and initiated extensive collaboration with theindustry. Specifically, SINTEF ER has taken a pioneering role in the development of knowledgefor integrated energy solutions for supermarketsas well as multi-ejectorexpansion work recovery in CO<sub>2</sub> cycles (CO2Heatpumpsand MULTIJETprojects). Theexpertise of SINTEF ER in these areas is highly recognized internationally and INDEE-N representsanexcellent <b>opportunity for the Norwegian research community to sustain andstrengthen this leading role worldwide.</b></dd></p></li><br>
	<li type="disc" style="font-size:18px">	<b>Relevance and benefit to society:</b>
	<dd><p align="justify">The living standard in India is growing rapidly, and consequently, also the number of refrigeration and air conditioning systems in offices, shoppingareas and private homes is increasing. Hence there is an urgent need for the development andcommissioning of refrigeration and AC systems with low environmental impact.</dd></li></p><br>
	<li type="disc" style="font-size:18px">	<b>Environmental impact: </b>
	<dd><p align="justify">The refrigeration community is more and more aware of that theusage of natural refrigerants will contribute to reduced environment impact and eliminate thedependency from costly imports of alternative synthetic low GWP refrigerants. Man-madechemicals are bound to harm the environment in the long run. As an example, CFC12 was uponits discovery known as a safe refrigerant in all aspects, however, discarded half century later.Currently HCFC22 with an ozone depleting effect is still dominating the Asian market.</dd></p></li><br>
	<li type="disc" style="font-size:18px"><b>	Ethical perspectives and gender issues: </b>
	<dd><p align="justify">The project will be conducted within the valuesof society and within the ethical guidelines of the SINTEF Group and no fundamental right arecontravened. Equal opportunities will be offered irrespective of gender. In accordance with theplans for equal opportunities and recruitment of women at SINTEF ER the project will keep aparticular focus on this issue and strive for a 50/50 split between men and women in researchpositions. The project will priorities women when the qualifications of men and women equal.</dd></p></li>
